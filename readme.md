# Show Me My Colors
It's a tool to help you understand all the colors you are using in a project. It gives you the unique colors but differentiates when it needs to, so you can find and fix.

## Benefits?
* You get to see all the colors in your project including the ones generated by LESS or SASS.
* It shows you the unique colors but shows you the duplicate ones when necessary like `#fff`, `#ffffff` and `rgb(255,255,255)`
* It also shows you the right color for your text for any given background. Pardon me for transparent ones. :(
* It remembers the CSS you worked with and loads them from localStorage when you come back. 

## How To Use?
Copy & Paste your project's CSS and hit the damn! button.

## Build
You need to have gulp installed in your machine. The project uses [Myth](http://myth.io) for compiling CSS. 
```bash
npm install
gulp
```
Gulp will watch for changes in CSS file while you work. 

Run it in a local server of your choice. If you have python installed, you could do:
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer # http://localhost:8000 
```
