# Chamarel
The name comes from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamarel);

It's a tool to help you understand all the colors you are using in a project. It gives you the unique colors but differentiates when it needs to, so you can find and fix.

## Benefits?
* You get to see all the colors in your project including the ones _generated_ by LESS or SASS.
* It shows you the unique colors but shows you the duplicate ones when necessary like `#fff`, `#ffffff` and `rgb(255,255,255)`.
* It also shows you the right color for your text for any given background.
* It remembers the CSS you worked with and loads them from `localStorage` when you come back. 

## How To Use?
Copy & paste your project's CSS and hit button!
